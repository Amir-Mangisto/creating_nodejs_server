(CNN)By agreeing in principle to a summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin, President Joe Biden is reaching for a signature foreign policy win, but accepting massive political and strategic risks that could easily backfire.

Biden's last-ditch, still-tentative and highly conditioned agreement to meet the Russian President came after a weekend of frenzied diplomacy and alarming new US claims that Russia was about to invade Ukraine.
There are real doubts that the meeting, brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron, will ever take place. The White House said Sunday it will go ahead only "if an invasion hasn't happened."
